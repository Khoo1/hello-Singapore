Singapore, The City of Lions

The prince from a neighbouring island, 'Sang Nila Utama', was exploring the seas for new land and made landfall on a new island. Upon arrival, he and his men were greeted by a strange sight; the appearrance of a powerful beast with a golden mane, which we call a lion. Hence, the prince named the island 'Singapura' or the City of Lions.
