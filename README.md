Singapore, The City of Lions

The story of Singapore began with a prince from a neighbouring island, 'Sang Nila Utama', who was exploring the seas for new land and made landfall on a new island. Upon arrival, he and his men were greeted by a strange sight; the appearrance of a powerful beast with a golden mane, which we call a lion. Hence, the prince named the island 'Singapura' or the City of Lions.

Singapore came from the Malay name of "Singapura", that translates to 'Lion City',  given by a prince some hundred years ago.
